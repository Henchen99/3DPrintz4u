# 3DPrintz4u

Hi

This is my second project I am attempting. It is an ecommerce website. I have owned a 3D printer for many years, occasionally printing things for fun. However, during lockdown, I decided to put more time into it as I really enjoyed the experience of designing things on Fusion 360 or Google sketchup from scratch, and seeing the actual product printed in real life. I then decided to use my skills to help print out custom unique dseigns that people wanted in the area and I came back with some really positive feedback which inspired me to create this website so that my skills could reach out to more people.

I wanted to improve my fullstack development however I didn't have time to learn a new language such as PHP or JavaScript etc so I decided to try Django as I was quite confident in Python already and had good knowledge of HTML and css already from my first project: DTbase

For the backbone of the website, I watched and followed a few youtube tutorials, with freeCodeCamp and Dennis Ivy in particular. I then changed and added additional features to suit the project better.
